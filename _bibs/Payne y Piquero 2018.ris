AB  - This study examines the concordance of self-reported and officially
      recorded criminal onset among a sample of prisoners in Queensland,
      Australia. Classified into one of four developmental stages, Gwetâ€™s
      Agreement Coefficient 1 (AC1) is used to examine the concordance of these
      two popular data sources. Analysis is conducted across seven offense
      types, and comparisons are made between Indigenous and non-Indigenous
      offenders. Results indicate moderate agreement between self-reports and
      official records with greater concordance for violent and serious property
      offenses. With few exceptions, self-reported onset precedes officially
      recorded onset, and concordance was greater for Indigenous offenders.
      These findings have important methodological implications for
      criminological research, in particular, developmental and life-course
      theory, which emphasizes the theoretical importance of the timing and
      sequencing of criminal events.
