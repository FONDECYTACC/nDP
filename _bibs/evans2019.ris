AB  - AIMS: To compare long-term criminal justice outcomes among
      opioid-dependent individuals randomized to receive buprenorphine or
      methadone. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A 5-year follow-up was
      conducted in 2011-14 of 303 opioid-dependent participants entering three
      opioid treatment programs in California, USA in 2006-09 and randomized to
      receive either buprenorphine/naloxone or methadone. INTERVENTION AND
      COMPARATOR: Participants received buprenorphine/naloxone (BUP; n = 179) or
      methadone (MET; n = 124) for 24 weeks and then were tapered off their
      treatment over â‰¤ 8 weeks or referred for ongoing clinical treatment.
      Midway through the study, the randomization scheme was switched from 1 : 1
      BUP : MET to 2 : 1 because of higher dropout in the BUP arm. MEASUREMENTS:
      Study outcomes included arrests and self-reported incarceration.
      Predictors included randomization condition (buprenorphine versus
      methadone), age, gender, race/ethnicity, use of cocaine, drug injection in
      the 30 days prior to baseline and study site. Treatment status
      (buprenorphine, methadone, none) during follow-up was included as a
      time-varying covariate. FINDINGS: There was no significant difference by
      randomization condition in the proportion arrested (buprenorphine: 55.3%,
      methadone: 54.0%) or incarcerated (40.9%, 47.3%) during follow-up. Among
      methadone-randomized individuals, arrest was less likely with methadone
      treatment (0.50, 0.35-0.72) during follow-up (relative to no treatment)
      and switching to buprenorphine had a lower likelihood of arrest than those
      receiving no treatment (0.39, 0.18-0.87). Among buprenorphine-randomized
      individuals, arrest was less likely with receipt of buprenorphine (0.49,
      0.33-0.75) during follow-up and switching to methadone had a similar
      likelihood of arrest as methadone-randomized individuals receiving no
      treatment. Likelihood of arrest was also negatively associated with older
      age (0.98, 0.96-1.00); it was positively associated with Hispanic
      ethnicity (1.63, 1.04-2.56), cocaine use (2.00, 1.33-3.03), injection drug
      use (2.19, 1.26-3.83), and study site. CONCLUSIONS: In a US sample of
      people treated for opioid use disorder, continued treatment with either
      buprenorphine or methadone was associated with a reduction in arrests
      relative to no treatment. Cocaine use, injection drug use, Hispanic
      ethnicity and younger age were associated with higher likelihood of
      arrest.
